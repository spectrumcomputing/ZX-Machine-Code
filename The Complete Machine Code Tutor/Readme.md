### The Complete Machine Code Tutor

The [Complete Machine Code Tutor](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/8031/ZX-Spectrum/The_Complete_Machine_Code_Tutor) was published by New Generation Software in 1984. During 2018 Nomad from the Spectrum Computing Forums took images of the screens from every lesson. These screens are presented here.

Follow the links below to view the screens for each of the lessons. Each page has links back here and to the next lesson.
