### The Complete Machine Code Tutor

The [Complete Machine Code Tutor](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/8031/ZX-Spectrum/The_Complete_Machine_Code_Tutor) was published by New Generation Software in 1984. During 2018 Nomad from the Spectrum Computing Forums took images of the screens from every lesson. These screens are presented here.
